# Six-class (negation + GLV) parallel Pollard rho in BLS12-381 G1

Parallel distinguished-point Pollard rho on the (r-1)/6 orbits of G1 under
<-1, phi>, phi(x, y) = (beta x, y). Class key |y| (free); the canonical twist index is
decided exactly from a truncated fixed-point product (exact fallback on
near-ties, metered separately); a twisted table makes each step one batched
affine G1 addition plus at most 200 instructions; fruitless cycles are escaped by
doubling the minimum-fingerprint class. A global work meter charges every action and halts at the claimed
bound, so W <= 2^126.36 on every run.

Claim: time_log2 = 126.36, success >= 0.39, memory < 2^72 bytes.
