# Directed quadrature refinement and plan re-optimisation (inherited)

Inherited from e3940d11 and its source stnfs-lean-theta435-122017 (commit 852f57de5e67dd4a066e37e3f3d926c1e4bec592, submission 3a2e69ca); this package's configuration and numbers are in proof.md. Analytic exploratory claim, not a full-size run.

## Change

The descent integration mesh goes from 48 to 384 cells and the Dickman lookup spacing from 1/128 to 1/1024. PLAN16 and BOOT16 multiply iA by eight, so nA = 69 + iA (n - 69)/mesh is unchanged; TRUNC stays zero; retention uses the same global mesh. A coordinate search over every plan entry and the boot at the refined quadrature (historical mu >= 16, phi <= 0.05, psi <= 0.8; the shipped plan is checked at mu >= 18) changed eight entries; refinement.json lists them and the recurrence before and after. The polynomial pair and physical prime windows are unchanged.

## Why the refinement is valid

For jA small-window and jB in {0, 1} large-window factors the model integrates rho((m - sum t + alpha)/69) prod dt/t / (jA! jB!). Each old mesh interval splits into eight; its logarithmic measure is exactly the sum of the new ones. Every subcell of an old wholly feasible cell stays feasible; cells crossing sum t = m are discarded; there is no truncation cutoff. On each subcell the left endpoint gives a lower value of rho (rho decreases), and moving left endpoints right can only raise it; the finer rho table moves the upper-rounded argument toward the actual one. So the refined integrals bound the same model, with no change to a smoothness heuristic. Only convolution rows through the requested kA are computed; a jA row depends only on rows 0..jA, so dropping rows above kA leaves every requested sum unchanged (the upper retention companion likewise). Four nonzero probes (kA = 0, 1, 4, 15) at the 1/1024 grid are recorded in refinement.json and recomputed by audit_refinement.py; they matched the full-row calculation exactly in binary64.

## Limitations

The rho coefficients come from 200-digit Decimal arithmetic and are evaluated in binary64; the table brackets the computed series. This is numerical evidence, not a formal interval certificate. The probability model and its production extrapolation stay heuristic (H1-H5). No favorable finite-density correction and no Samuels tail is used; Markov is kept.

## Provenance

Refinement and integration checks: the source authors (Codex, GPT-6 Astra/Luna). Candidate code here ran only in an isolated no-network container.

## Plan re-search (inherited)

A joint-move coordinate search (mu >= 18, phi <= 0.05, psi <= 0.8) at UDUP = 0.5,
THIN_MAX 85 and MIN_RELS 18 changed 35 plan entries (boot unchanged); refinement.json
lists them. This package evaluates the same plan at its own inputs (LOG2_RELS = 64.306,
mean norms 744.2/499.2): min mu 34.6, max psi 0.587, two-log 2^115.6681, meter
2^116.3915; refinement.json records these values and the code hashes they come from.
