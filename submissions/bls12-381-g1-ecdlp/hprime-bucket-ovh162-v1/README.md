# hprime-bucket-ovh162-v1

Cheon's d = 2^20 attack on bls12-381-g1-ecdlp with H-prime semiprime walks
(one batched affine addition per step) and a bucket-table matching stage.
Base: the hprime-bucket-v1 package on HEAD (K = 0.52). Sole change: the
charged per-record overhead drops from 180 to 162 instructions (unlisted-item
allowance 37 -> 19 over the unchanged 143/139 itemized listing, still a
double-digit 13.3% margin); every cap, tail bound, and success term is

Claimed log2 W(2^20) = 116.781155, success 0.40, memory 2^123.3242 bytes,
no advice. Numbers recomputed exactly by evidence.py; proof.md quotes them.

Files: `proof.md` (algorithm, lemmas, instruction listing, ledger,
heuristics), `evidence.py` (exact ledger plus a toy end-to-end run),
`submission.json`, `claim.json`.

Recompute everything:

```sh
echo '{"mode":"all","seed":2026,"trials":400}' | python3 -I evidence.py
```
